# PyData Southampton Meetup #1
Hosted by Carnival UK.

## Talk 1
### Speaker: Robin Wilson
### Title: An Introduction to geospatial data & processing
### Abstract: 
In this talk, Robin will introduce geospatial data and how to process it using Python. He'll explain what geospatial data is, and what makes it different from normal data. He'll cover the types of geospatial data, issues relating to co-ordinate systems, and where to get geospatial data, before diving into a couple of case studies of geospatial data processing with Python using libraries including GeoPandas, rasterio, shapely, rasterstats, folium and more.

## Talk 2
### Speaker: Chris Frohmaier
### Title: MoleGazer: Where astronomy meets dermatology
### Abstract: 
Astronomers routinely scan the night sky with the ambition of discovering exploding stars in distant galaxies. Many of the techniques can be summarised simply by 'blob detection and evolution'. Dermatologists are also interested in blobs, but on a very different scale and with potentially serious health outcomes. Incidence of melanoma (skin cancer) is rapidly increasing in the UK and worldwide, with early detection and treatment crucial in improving patient outcomes. Molegazer is a project led by astronomers at the University of Southampton and dermatologists at Oxford University Hospital Trust. We apply principles from astronomical surveys to work towards our goal of routinely mapping the evolution of naevi on high-risk patients. This presentation will showcase the Molegazer project, and will discuss some of the techniques we use in the python ecosystem, drawing on OpenCV, scikit-learn, keras, and more.
