## Talk 2
### Speaker: Adam Hill
### Title: Building a data science solution for an NGO when you don’t know what infrastructure it will run on: a case study predicting tutor supply and demand mismatch 
### Abstract: 
The Brilliant Club is an NGO focused on two goals: student access and student success. TBC wants more pupils from less advantaged backgrounds to access university; their aim is to work with 100,000 pupils on their flagship Scholars Programme over the next five years.
To achieve these aims, TBC needs to ensure that they have the right number of PhD researcher volunteers in the right areas to meet school demand.

A team of 6 DataKind volunteers worked to explore the data, and make a maintainable, functional set of models that could help in the prediction of TBC’s tutor supply and demand using the latest available data and visualising it in an easy-to-use manner. We built our solution around various open-source tools and technologies including: Python; Scikit-learn; Jupyter; Docker; PostgreSQL; dbt; Prefect. In this talk, we will discuss how we designed the solution to deliver it in an accessible way and demonstrate how we implemented the various technologies.
